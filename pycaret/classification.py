    """
    This function initializes the environment in pycaret and creates the transformation
    pipeline to prepare the data for modeling and deployment. setup() must called before
    executing any other function in pycaret. It takes two mandatory parameters:
    data and name of the target column.
    
    All other parameters are optional.

    Example
    -------
    >>> from pycaret.datasets import get_data
    >>> juice = get_data('juice')
    >>> experiment_name = setup(data = juice,  target = 'Purchase')

    'juice' is a pandas.DataFrame  and 'Purchase' is the name of target column.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : pandas.DataFrame
        Shape (n_samples, n_features) where n_samples is the number of samples and 
        n_features is the number of features.

    target: str
        Name of the target column to be passed in as a string. The target variable can 
        be either binary or multiclass.

    train_size: float, default = 0.7
        Size of the training set. By default, 70% of the data will be used for training 
        and validation. The remaining data will be used for a test / hold-out set.

    test_data: pandas.DataFrame, default = None
        When a dataframe is passed to this parameter it will be used as the test set, instead
        of using a portion of the data to create one.

    preprocess: bool, default = True
        If False, will not do any preprocessing on the data aside from mandatory steps, and
        ignore all other parameters related to preprocessing (including 'ordinal_features' and 
        'high_cardinality_features' params), aside from 'custom_pipeline'.

    imputation_type: str, default = 'simple'
        The type of imputation to use. Can be either 'simple' or 'iterative'.

    categorical_features: list, default = None
        If the inferred data types are not correct, categorical_features can be used to
        overwrite the inferred type. If when running setup the type of 'column1' is
        inferred as numeric instead of categorical, then this parameter can be used 
        to overwrite the type by passing categorical_features = ['column1'].
    
    categorical_imputation: str, default = 'constant'
        If missing values are found in categorical features, they will be imputed with
        a constant 'not_available' value. The other available option is 'mode' which 
        imputes the missing value using most frequent value in the training dataset. 
    
    ordinal_features: dictionary, default = None
        When the data contains ordinal features, they must be encoded differently using 
        the ordinal_features param. If the data has a categorical variable with values
        of 'low', 'medium', 'high' and it is known that low < medium < high, then it can 
        be passed as ordinal_features = { 'column_name' : ['low', 'medium', 'high'] }. 
        The list sequence must be in increasing order from lowest to highest.
    
    high_cardinality_features: list, default = None
        When the data containts features with high cardinality, they can be compressed
        into fewer levels by passing them as a list of column names with high cardinality.
        Features are compressed using method defined in high_cardinality_method param.
    
    high_cardinality_method: str, default = 'frequency'
        When method set to 'frequency' it will replace the original value of feature
        with the frequency distribution and convert the feature into numeric. Other
        available method is 'clustering' which performs the clustering on statistical
        attribute of data and replaces the original value of feature with cluster label.
        The number of clusters is determined using a combination of Calinski-Harabasz and 
        Silhouette criterion. 
          
    numeric_features: list, default = None
        If the inferred data types are not correct, numeric_features can be used to
        overwrite the inferred type. If when running setup the type of 'column1' is 
        inferred as a categorical instead of numeric, then this parameter can be used 
        to overwrite by passing numeric_features = ['column1'].    

    numeric_imputation: str, default = 'mean'
        If missing values are found in numeric features, they will be imputed with the 
        mean value of the feature. The other available options are 'median' which imputes 
        the value using the median value in the training dataset and 'zero' which
        replaces missing values with zeroes.

    date_features: str, default = None
        If the data has a DateTime column that is not automatically detected when running
        setup, this parameter can be used by passing date_features = 'date_column_name'. 
        It can work with multiple date columns. Date columns are not used in modeling. 
        Instead, feature extraction is performed and date columns are dropped from the 
        dataset. If the date column includes a time stamp, features related to time will 
        also be extracted.

    ignore_features: str, default = None
        If any feature should be ignored for modeling, it can be passed to the param
        ignore_features. The ID and DateTime columns when inferred, are automatically 
        set to ignore for modeling. 

    normalize: bool, default = False
        When set to True, the feature space is transformed using the normalized_method
        param. Generally, linear algorithms perform better with normalized data however, 
        the results may vary and it is advised to run multiple experiments to evaluate
        the benefit of normalization.

    normalize_method: str, default = 'zscore'
        Defines the method to be used for normalization. By default, normalize method
        is set to 'zscore'. The standard zscore is calculated as z = (x - u) / s. The
        other available options are:

        'minmax'    : scales and translates each feature individually such that it is in 
                    the range of 0 - 1.
        
        'maxabs'    : scales and translates each feature individually such that the maximal 
                    absolute value of each feature will be 1.0. It does not shift/center 
                    the data, and thus does not destroy any sparsity.
        
        'robust'    : scales and translates each feature according to the Interquartile 
                    range. When the dataset contains outliers, robust scaler often gives 
                    better results.
    
    transformation: bool, default = False
        When set to True, a power transformation is applied to make the data more normal /
        Gaussian-like. This is useful for modeling issues related to heteroscedasticity or 
        other situations where normality is desired. The optimal parameter for stabilizing 
        variance and minimizing skewness is estimated through maximum likelihood.

    transformation_method: str, default = 'yeo-johnson'
        Defines the method for transformation. By default, the transformation method is set
        to 'yeo-johnson'. The other available option is 'quantile' transformation. Both 
        the transformation transforms the feature set to follow a Gaussian-like or normal
        distribution. Note that the quantile transformer is non-linear and may distort 
        linear correlations between variables measured at the same scale.
    
    handle_unknown_categorical: bool, default = True
        When set to True, unknown categorical levels in new / unseen data are replaced by
        the most or least frequent level as learned in the training data. The method is 
        defined under the unknown_categorical_method param.

    unknown_categorical_method: str, default = 'least_frequent'
        Method used to replace unknown categorical levels in unseen data. Method can be
        set to 'least_frequent' or 'most_frequent'.

    pca: bool, default = False
        When set to True, dimensionality reduction is applied to project the data into 
        a lower dimensional space using the method defined in pca_method param. In 
        supervised learning pca is generally performed when dealing with high feature
        space and memory is a constraint. Note that not all datasets can be decomposed
        efficiently using a linear PCA technique and that applying PCA may result in loss 
        of information. As such, it is advised to run multiple experiments with different 
        pca_methods to evaluate the impact. 

    pca_method: str, default = 'linear'
        The 'linear' method performs Linear dimensionality reduction using Singular Value 
        Decomposition. The other available options are:
        
        kernel      : dimensionality reduction through the use of RVF kernel.  
        
        incremental : replacement for 'linear' pca when the dataset to be decomposed is 
                    too large to fit in memory

    pca_components: int/float, default = 0.99
        Number of components to keep. if pca_components is a float, it is treated as a 
        target percentage for information retention. When pca_components is an integer
        it is treated as the number of features to be kept. pca_components must be strictly
        less than the original number of features in the dataset.

    ignore_low_variance: bool, default = False
        When set to True, all categorical features with insignificant variances are 
        removed from the dataset. The variance is calculated using the ratio of unique 
        values to the number of samples, and the ratio of the most common value to the 
        frequency of the second most common value.
    
    combine_rare_levels: bool, default = False
        When set to True, all levels in categorical features below the threshold defined 
        in rare_level_threshold param are combined together as a single level. There must 
        be atleast two levels under the threshold for this to take effect. 
        rare_level_threshold represents the percentile distribution of level frequency. 
        Generally, this technique is applied to limit a sparse matrix caused by high 
        numbers of levels in categorical features. 
    
    rare_level_threshold: float, default = 0.1
        Percentile distribution below which rare categories are combined. Only comes into
        effect when combine_rare_levels is set to True.
    
    bin_numeric_features: list, default = None
        When a list of numeric features is passed they are transformed into categorical
        features using KMeans, where values in each bin have the same nearest center of a 
        1D k-means cluster. The number of clusters are determined based on the 'sturges' 
        method. It is only optimal for gaussian data and underestimates the number of bins 
        for large non-gaussian datasets.

    remove_outliers: bool, default = False
        When set to True, outliers from the training data are removed using PCA linear
        dimensionality reduction using the Singular Value Decomposition technique.

    outliers_threshold: float, default = 0.05
        The percentage / proportion of outliers in the dataset can be defined using
        the outliers_threshold param. By default, 0.05 is used which means 0.025 of the 
        values on each side of the distribution's tail are dropped from training data.

    remove_multicollinearity: bool, default = False
        When set to True, the variables with inter-correlations higher than the threshold
        defined under the multicollinearity_threshold param are dropped. When two features
        are highly correlated with each other, the feature that is less correlated with 
        the target variable is dropped. 

    multicollinearity_threshold: float, default = 0.9
        Threshold used for dropping the correlated features. Only comes into effect when 
        remove_multicollinearity is set to True.
    
    remove_perfect_collinearity: bool, default = True
        When set to True, perfect collinearity (features with correlation = 1) is removed
        from the dataset, When two features are 100% correlated, one of it is randomly 
        dropped from the dataset.

    create_clusters: bool, default = False
        When set to True, an additional feature is created where each instance is assigned
        to a cluster. The number of clusters is determined using a combination of 
        Calinski-Harabasz and Silhouette criterion. 

    cluster_iter: int, default = 20
        Number of iterations used to create a cluster. Each iteration represents cluster 
        size. Only comes into effect when create_clusters param is set to True.

    polynomial_features: bool, default = False
        When set to True, new features are created based on all polynomial combinations 
        that exist within the numeric features in a dataset to the degree defined in 
        polynomial_degree param. 

    polynomial_degree: int, default = 2pca_method_pass
        Degree of polynomial features. For example, if an input sample is two dimensional 
        and of the form [a, b], the polynomial features with degree = 2 are: 
        [1, a, b, a^2, ab, b^2].

    trigonometry_features: bool, default = False
        When set to True, new features are created based on all trigonometric combinations 
        that exist within the numeric features in a dataset to the degree defined in the
        polynomial_degree param.

    polynomial_threshold: float, default = 0.1
        This is used to compress a sparse matrix of polynomial and trigonometric features.
        Polynomial and trigonometric features whose feature importance based on the 
        combination of Random Forest, AdaBoost and Linear correlation falls within the 
        percentile of the defined threshold are kept in the dataset. Remaining features 
        are dropped before further processing.

    group_features: list or list of list, default = None
        When a dataset contains features that have related characteristics, group_features
        param can be used for statistical feature extraction. For example, if a dataset has 
        numeric features that are related with each other (i.e 'Col1', 'Col2', 'Col3'), a 
        list containing the column names can be passed under group_features to extract 
        statistical information such as the mean, median, mode and standard deviation.
    
    group_names: list, default = None
        When group_features is passed, a name of the group can be passed into the 
        group_names param as a list containing strings. The length of a group_names 
        list must equal to the length  of group_features. When the length doesn't 
        match or the name is not passed, new features are sequentially named such as 
        group_1, group_2 etc.
    
    feature_selection: bool, default = False
        When set to True, a subset of features are selected using a combination of various
        permutation importance techniques including Random Forest, Adaboost and Linear 
        correlation with target variable. The size of the subset is dependent on the 
        feature_selection_param. Generally, this is used to constrain the feature space 
        in order to improve efficiency in modeling. When polynomial_features and 
        feature_interaction  are used, it is highly recommended to define the 
        feature_selection_threshold param with a lower value. Feature selection algorithm
        by default is 'classic' but could be 'boruta', which will lead PyCaret to create
        use the Boruta selection algorithm.

    feature_selection_threshold: float, default = 0.8
        Threshold used for feature selection (including newly created polynomial features).
        A higher value will result in a higher feature space. It is recommended to do 
        multiple trials with different values of feature_selection_threshold specially in 
        cases where polynomial_features and feature_interaction are used. Setting a very 
        low value may be efficient but could result in under-fitting.
    
    feature_selection_method: str, default = 'classic'
        Can be either 'classic' or 'boruta'. Selects the algorithm responsible for
        choosing a subset of features. For the 'classic' selection method, PyCaret will 
        use various permutation importance techniques. For the 'boruta' algorithm, PyCaret
        will create an instance of boosted trees model, which will iterate with permutation 
        over all features and choose the best ones based on the distributions of feature 
        importance.
    
    feature_interaction: bool, default = False 
        When set to True, it will create new features by interacting (a * b) for all 
        numeric variables in the dataset including polynomial and trigonometric features 
        (if created). This feature is not scalable and may not work as expected on datasets
        with large feature space.
    
    feature_ratio: bool, default = False
        When set to True, it will create new features by calculating the ratios (a / b) 
        of all numeric variables in the dataset. This feature is not scalable and may not 
        work as expected on datasets with large feature space.
    
    interaction_threshold: bool, default = 0.01
        Similar to polynomial_threshold, It is used to compress a sparse matrix of newly 
        created features through interaction. Features whose importance based on the 
        combination  of  Random Forest, AdaBoost and Linear correlation falls within the 
        percentile of the  defined threshold are kept in the dataset. Remaining features 
        are dropped before further processing.
    
    fix_imbalance: bool, default = False
        When dataset has unequal distribution of target class it can be fixed using
        fix_imbalance parameter. When set to True, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling 
        Technique) is applied by default to create synthetic datapoints for minority class.

    fix_imbalance_method: obj, default = None
        When fix_imbalance is set to True and fix_imbalance_method is None, 'smote' is 
        applied by default to oversample minority class during cross validation. This 
        parameter accepts any module from 'imblearn' that supports 'fit_resample' method.

    data_split_shuffle: bool, default = True
        If set to False, prevents shuffling of rows when splitting data.

    data_split_stratify: bool or list, default = False
        Whether to stratify when splitting data.
        If True, will stratify by the target column. If False, will not stratify.
        If list is passed, will stratify by the columns with the names in the list.
        Requires data_split_shuffle to be set to True.

    fold_strategy: str or scikit-learn compatible CV generator object, default = 'stratifiedkfold'
        Choice of cross validation strategy. Possible values are:

        * 'kfold' for KFold CV,
        * 'stratifiedkfold' for Stratified KFold CV,
        * 'groupkfold' for Group KFold CV,
        * 'timeseries' for TimeSeriesSplit CV,
        * a custom CV generator object compatible with scikit-learn.

    fold: int, default = 10
        Number of folds to be used in cross validation. Must be at least 2.
        Ignored if fold_strategy is an object.

    fold_shuffle: bool, default = False
        If set to False, prevents shuffling of rows when using cross validation. Only applicable for
        'kfold' and 'stratifiedkfold' fold_strategy. Ignored if fold_strategy is an object.
    
    fold_groups: str or array-like, with shape (n_samples,), default = None
        Optional Group labels for the samples used while splitting the dataset into train/test set.
        If string is passed, will use the data column with that name as the groups.
        Only used if a group based cross-validation generator is used (eg. GroupKFold).

    n_jobs: int, default = -1
        The number of jobs to run in parallel (for functions that supports parallel 
        processing) -1 means using all processors. To run all functions on single 
        processor set n_jobs to None.

    use_gpu: str or bool, default = False
        If set to 'force', will try to use GPU with all algorithms that support it,
        and raise exceptions if they are unavailable.
        If set to True, will use GPU with algorithms that support it, and fall
        back to CPU if they are unavailable.
        If set to False, will only use CPU.

        GPU enabled algorithms:
        
        - CatBoost
        - XGBoost
        - LightGBM - requires https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GPU-Tutorial.html
        - Logistic Regression, Ridge, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, SVC - requires cuML >= 0.15 to be installed.
          https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml

    custom_pipeline: transformer or list of transformers or tuple
    (str, transformer) or list of tuples (str, transformer), default = None
        If set, will append the passed transformers (including Pipelines) to the PyCaret
        preprocessing Pipeline applied after train-test split during model fitting.
        This Pipeline is applied on each CV fold separately and on the final fit.
        The transformers will be applied before PyCaret transformers (eg. SMOTE).

    html: bool, default = True
        If set to False, prevents runtime display of monitor. This must be set to False
        when using environment that doesnt support HTML.

    session_id: int, default = None
        If None, a random seed is generated and returned in the Information grid. The 
        unique number is then distributed as a seed in all functions used during the 
        experiment. This can be used for later reproducibility of the entire experiment.

    log_experiment: bool, default = False
        When set to True, all metrics and parameters are logged on MLFlow server.

    experiment_name: str, default = None
        Name of experiment for logging. When set to None, 'clf' is by default used as 
        alias for the experiment name.

    log_plots: bool or list, default = False
        When set to True, AUC, Confusion Matrix and Feature Importance plots will be logged.
        When set to a list of plot IDs (consult ``plot_model``), will log those plots.
        If False, will log no plots. 

    log_profile: bool, default = False
        When set to True, data profile is also logged on MLflow as a html file. 
        By default, it is set to False. 

    log_data: bool, default = False
        When set to True, train and test dataset are logged as csv. 

    silent: bool, default = False
        When set to True, confirmation of data types is not required. All preprocessing 
        will be performed assuming automatically inferred data types. Not recommended 
        for direct use except for established pipelines.
    
    verbose: bool, default = True
        Information grid is not printed when verbose is set to False.

    profile: bool, default = False
        If set to true, a data profile for Exploratory Data Analysis will be displayed 
        in an interactive HTML report. 

    Warnings
    --------
    - Some GPU models require conversion from float64 to float32,
      which may result in loss of precision. It should not be an issue in majority of cases.
      Models impacted:

        * cuml.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier

    This function train all the models available in the model library and scores them 
    using Cross Validation. The output prints a score grid with Accuracy, 
    AUC, Recall, Precision, F1, Kappa and MCC (averaged across folds).
    
    This function returns all of the models compared, sorted by the value of the selected metric.

    To select top N models, use n_select parameter that is set to 1 by default.
    Where n_select parameter > 1, it will return a list of trained model objects.

    When turbo is set to True ('rbfsvm', 'gpc' and 'mlp') are excluded due to longer
    training time. By default turbo param is set to True.

    Example
    -------
    >>> from pycaret.datasets import get_data
    >>> juice = get_data('juice')
    >>> experiment_name = setup(data = juice,  target = 'Purchase')
    >>> best_model = compare_models() 

    This will return the averaged score grid of all the models except 'rbfsvm', 'gpc' 
    and 'mlp'. When turbo param is set to False, all models including 'rbfsvm', 'gpc' 
    and 'mlp' are used but this may result in longer training time.
    
    >>> best_model = compare_models( exclude = [ 'knn', 'gbc' ] , turbo = False) 

    This will return a comparison of all models except K Nearest Neighbour and
    Gradient Boosting Classifier.
    
    >>> best_model = compare_models( exclude = [ 'knn', 'gbc' ] , turbo = True) 

    This will return comparison of all models except K Nearest Neighbour, 
    Gradient Boosting Classifier, SVM (RBF), Gaussian Process Classifier and
    Multi Level Perceptron.
        

    >>> tuned_model = tune_model(create_model('lr'))
    >>> best_model = compare_models( include = [ 'lr', tuned_model ]) 

    This will compare a tuned Linear Regression model with an untuned one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    exclude: list of strings, default = None
        In order to omit certain models from the comparison model ID's can be passed as 
        a list of strings in exclude param. 

    include: list of strings or objects, default = None
        In order to run only certain models for the comparison, the model ID's can be 
        passed as a list of strings in include param. The list can also include estimator
        objects to be compared.

    fold: int or scikit-learn compatible CV generator, default = None
        Controls cross-validation. If None, will use the CV generator defined in setup().
        If integer, will use StratifiedKFold CV with that many folds.
        When cross_validation is False, this parameter is ignored.

    round: int, default = 4
        Number of decimal places the metrics in the score grid will be rounded to.
  
    cross_validation: bool, default = True
        When cross_validation set to False fold parameter is ignored and models are trained
        on entire training dataset, returning metrics calculated using the train (holdout) set.

    sort: str, default = 'Accuracy'
        The scoring measure specified is used for sorting the average score grid
        Other options are 'AUC', 'Recall', 'Precision', 'F1', 'Kappa' and 'MCC'.

    n_select: int, default = 1
        Number of top_n models to return. use negative argument for bottom selection.
        for example, n_select = -3 means bottom 3 models.

    budget_time: int or float, default = None
        If not 0 or None, will terminate execution of the function after budget_time 
        minutes have passed and return results up to that point.

    turbo: bool, default = True
        When turbo is set to True, it excludes estimators that have longer
        training time.

    errors: str, default = 'ignore'
        If 'ignore', will suppress model exceptions and continue.
        If 'raise', will allow exceptions to be raised.

    fit_kwargs: dict, default = {} (empty dict)
        Dictionary of arguments passed to the fit method of the model. The parameters will be applied to all models,
        therefore it is recommended to set errors parameter to 'ignore'.

    groups: str or array-like, with shape (n_samples,), default = None
        Optional Group labels for the samples used while splitting the dataset into train/test set.
        If string is passed, will use the data column with that name as the groups.
        Only used if a group based cross-validation generator is used (eg. GroupKFold).
        If None, will use the value set in fold_groups param in setup().

    verbose: bool, default = True
        Score grid is not printed when verbose is set to False.
    
    Returns
    -------
    score_grid
        A table containing the scores of the model across the kfolds. 
        Scoring metrics used are Accuracy, AUC, Recall, Precision, F1, 
        Kappa and MCC. Mean and standard deviation of the scores across 
        the folds are also returned.

    list or model
        List or one fitted model objects that were compared.

    Warnings
    --------
    - compare_models() though attractive, might be time consuming with large 
      datasets. By default turbo is set to True, which excludes models that
      have longer training times. Changing turbo parameter to False may result 
      in very high training times with datasets where number of samples exceed 
      10,000.

    - If target variable is multiclass (more than 2 classes), AUC will be 
      returned as zero (0.0)

    - If cross_validation param is set to False, no models will be logged with MLFlow.

    early_stopping: bool or str or object, default = False
        Use early stopping to stop fitting to a hyperparameter configuration 
        if it performs poorly. Ignored if search_library is ``scikit-learn``, or
        if the estimator doesn't have partial_fit attribute.

        If None, will use the value set in fold_groups param in setup().

    return_tuner: bool, default = False
        If True, will reutrn a tuple of (model, tuner_object). Otherwise,
        will return just the best model.

    - If a VotingClassifier is passed, the weights will be tuned.

    Warnings
    --------

    - Using 'Grid' search algorithm with default parameter grids may result in very
      long computation.

    This function takes a trained model object and returns an interpretation plot

    SHAP connects game theory with local explanations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : object, default = none
        A trained tree based model object should be passed as an estimator. 

    plot : str, default = 'summary'
        Other available options are 'correlation' and 'reason'.

    feature: str, default = None
        This parameter is only needed when plot = 'correlation'. By default feature is 
        set to None which means the first column of the dataset will be used as a 
        variable. A feature parameter must be passed to change this.

    observation: int, default = None
        This parameter only comes into effect when plot is set to 'reason'. If no 
        observation number is provided, it will return an analysis of all observations 
        with the option to select the feature on x and y axes through drop down 
        interactivity. For analysis at the sample level, an observation parameter must
        be passed with the index value of the observation in test / hold-out set. 

    **kwargs: 
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to the plot.

    Returns
    -------
    Visual_Plot
        Returns the visual plot.
        Returns the interactive JS plot when plot = 'reason'.

    type aws configure in your python command line. The following information is
    required which can be generated using the Identity and Access Management (IAM) 
    portal of your amazon console account:

    - AWS Access Key ID
    - AWS Secret Key Access
    - Default Region Name (can be seen under Global settings on your AWS console)
    - Default output format (must be left blank)

    For GCP users:
    --------------
    Before deploying a model to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), project must be created 
    either using command line or GCP console. Once project is created, you must create 
    a service account and download the service account key as a JSON file, which is 
    then used to set environment variable.

    For Azure users:
    ---------------
    Before deploying a model to Microsoft's Azure (Azure), environment variables
    for connection string must be set. In order to get connection string, user has
    to create account of Azure. Once it is done, create a Storage account. In the settings
    section of storage account, user can get the connection string.

    target: str, default = 'pred'
        The target of the score function.
        - 'pred' for the prediction table
        - 'pred_proba' for pred_proba
        - 'threshold' for decision_function or predict_proba

    greater_is_better: bool, default = True
        Whether score_func is a score function (default), meaning high is good,
        or a loss function, meaning low is good. In the latter case, the
        scorer object will sign-flip the outcome of the score_func.

    multiclass: bool, default = True
        Whether the metric supports multiclass problems.

    **kwargs:
        Arguments to be passed to score function.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.Series
        The created row as Series.
